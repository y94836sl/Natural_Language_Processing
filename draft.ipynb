Bart makes phone calls to various countries in the Southern Hemisphere to confirm this, such as a research station in Antarctica, Buenos Aires, Santiago and (incorrectly) Burkina Faso. When Lisa points out how expensive overseas calls are, Bart instead makes a collect call to Australia, where a boy named Tobias Drundridge answers the phone. Bart impersonates an adult bureaucrat and is told the sink and toilet are both draining clockwise. Frustrated, Bart asks Tobias to check his neighbors' toilets. The call takes six hours to complete, since Tobias lives in the rural locality of Squatter's Crog and Bart fails to hang up the phone.\\n\",\n",

However, Bruno's neighbor is a federal Member of Parliament, who reports the matter to the Prime Minister. After several letters from the Prime Minister and the Solicitor-General, the government of Australia indicts Bart for fraud. A U.S. State Department official arrives and explains that Bart has worsened already acrimonious Australia–United States relations.

When Bart sees a sign prohibiting foreign visitors from bringing in invasive species, he leaves his pet bullfrog at the airport. A kangaroo puts the frog in its marsupial pouch, introducing it into the wild. Bart makes his public apology, but an unsatisfied Parliament demands Bart receive a \"booting\" — a kick on the buttocks with an oversize boot — as corporal punishment. Desperate, Bart and Homer escape and the family flees to the embassy, chased by a large, angry mob. After a stand-off, the two governments propose a compromise: one kick from the Prime Minister, through the gate of the embassy, with a regular wing-tip shoe. Marge protests, but Bart agrees to the punishment. However, Bart dodges the kick, moons the Australians with the words \"Don\\'t tread on me\" written on his buttocks, and hums \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". The outraged mob storms the embassy, and the Simpsons and the embassy staff are evacuated by helicopter. From the air, the Simpsons notice that Bart\\'s bullfrog has reproduced and its offspring are wreaking havoc on Australia\\'s ecosystem and farms.

That was our evil side coming out: We\\'ll take our knowledge of Australia and we\\'ll twist it around to stimulate an audience and annoy them at the same time.\"[12] Despite being criticized for mocking the country, the episode received positive reviews from Australians, too.

Disappointed, Bart and Lisa persuade Homer to buy a swimming pool for their house, but when word spreads that the Simpsons have built their own pool, a massive crowd of children from Springfield Elementary School show up at their house and a pool party quickly ensues.

That night, Bart becomes gradually more concerned about his next door neighbor Ned Flanders after he first hears a womanly scream from the Flanders house and later witnesses Ned digging a grave in the backyard, expressing remorse that he\\'s become a \"murderer\". The next day, Bart overhears Ned telling his sons Rod and Todd that their mother is \"with God\" and they will soon join her.

Bart, afraid of what he thinks will happen to Lisa if Ned catches her, leaps out of his chair and struggles to chase after Ned in spite of his broken leg. He follows Ned into the attic, where Lisa has hidden herself, and they both start screaming in terror, only to watch as Ned puts the axe away for safekeeping.

The earthquake damaged much of the Film Roman building in which The Simpsons writing and animation staff worked, forcing them to move out for three months and continue production in a temporary building.[6] The only staff members that came in expecting to work were future show runners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein.[5] As a result, the staff was given a month more than they would usually have had to work on the episode, which Reardon described as \"greatly benefiting\" it.[6] Having been a director on the series for five years before this episode, he believed that this \"was closer to what [he] was trying to achieve as a director than [he] had done before\".[6] He credited this to the extra time, and used it to insert little details, such as having Bart get stuck on the fabric of the chair he was in,[6] and wearing his underwear instead of a swimsuit.[7]\\n',\n",

After a few suggestions—including one from a poorly-disguised Burns to invest the money back into his power plant—Marge nearly convinces them to repair the rundown Main Street, but a fast-talking salesman named Lyle Lanley leads a song-and-dance routine that convinces the townspeople to instead build a monorail. After running a questionable training program, Lanley randomly selects Homer as the monorail's conductor. Doubtful about Lanley, Marge visits his office and discovers he intends to run off with money skimmed from the project, leaving the townspeople with a defective train.\\n\",\n",

She meets Sebastian Cobb, the engineer who designed it, and he confirms that all of Lanley's monorail projects are scams. Cobb offers to help Marge prevent Springfield from suffering the same fate. At the Springfield monorail's inaugural run, Lanley arranges for Leonard Nimoy to be present at a well-attended opening ceremony, which is a diversion that enables him to escape on a plane to Tahiti. When the flight makes an unexpected stopover in North Haverbrook, the townsfolk storm the aircraft to attack Lanley for ruining the town.\\n\",\n",

The train stops briefly during a solar eclipse, then starts again. As Chief Wiggum and Mayor Quimby argue over who takes charge, Marge and Cobb contact Homer by radio and Cobb tells him he must find an anchor to stop the train. Improvising quickly, Homer pries loose the metal \"M\" from the engine\\'s side logo, ties a rope to it, and throws it from the train. After damaging a large portion of the town—especially the already-derelict roads—the \"M\" catches on the giant donut of the Lard Lad Donut store\\'s sign and the rope holds, stopping the monorail. As the passengers are rescued, Marge concludes that the monorail was the only foolish project the town ever embarked on, except for a skyscraper made from Popsicle sticks, a 50-foot-tall magnifying glass, and an up-escalator that leads nowhere.[2][3][8]\\n',\n",

After demanding several script changes,[6] Takei declined, saying he did not want to make fun of public transportation as he was a member of the board of directors of the Southern California Rapid Transit District (now the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority).

So the \\'Homer doesn\\'t go to church\\' storyline was given to George Meyer.\"[5]\\xa0Reiss and Jean thought that as a lapsed\\xa0Catholic, Meyer would \"bring the proper degree of rage\" to the episode. Meyer had a lot of fun making the episode, thinking that most people could relate to the bliss of staying home from church.[6]\\xa0One of the main problems Meyer had writing this episode is that whenever Homer saw God, he had to have fallen asleep so that it appeared to be a dream. Meyer did not want to show that God was literally appearing to Homer. This resulted in him falling asleep so many times during the first draft of the episode that it was almost as if Homer had\\xa0narcolepsy.[6]\\xa0This was also the first episode from season four that was read to the production team. Although first reads on previous seasons had not been well received by the production team, \"Homer the Heretic\" read very well, particularly some of the visuals in the third act, such as the house on fire and Homer being rescued by Flanders.[5]\\n',\n",

The idea for the song sung by the children was from a 1960s TV show called\\xa0Camp Runamuck, which has a theme song that is similar to the\\xa0Kamp Krusty\\xa0song.[1][5]\\n',\n",

       "  '\"Dog of Death\" also parodies lottery advertisements. In one commercial featured in the episode, an announcement states: \"The\\xa0state lottery, where everybody wins,\" while a tiny disclaimer at the bottom of the screen can be seen saying: \"Actual odds of winning, one in 380,000,000\".[13]\\xa0During the peak of the lottery fever in Springfield, news anchor Kent Brockman announces on television that people hoping to get tips on how to win the jackpot have borrowed every available copy of\\xa0Shirley Jackson\\'s book\\xa0The Lottery\\xa0at the local library. One of them is Homer, who throws the book into the\\xa0fireplace\\xa0after Kent reveals that \"Of course, the book does not contain any hints on how to win the lottery. It is, rather, a chilling tale of\\xa0conformity\\xa0gone mad.\"[14]\\xa0In her book\\xa0Shirley Jackson: Essays on the Literary Legacy, Bernice Murphy comments that this scene displays some of the most contradictory things about Jackson: \"It says a lot about the visibility of Jackson\\'s most notorious tale that more than 50 years after its initial creation it is still famous enough to warrant a mention in the world\\'s most famous sitcom. The fact that Springfield\\'s citizenry also miss the point of Jackson\\'s story completely [...] can perhaps be seen as an indication of a more general misrepresentation of Jackson and her work.\"[14]\\n',\n",
       "  'The episode contains several references to previous episodes of\\xa0The Simpsons. For instance, Santa\\'s Little Helper gets picked up by a car on a street called \"Michael Jackson Expressway\", a reference to the season-three premiere episode \"Stark Raving Dad\", in which Mayor Quimby had the expressway renamed in honor of an expected visit by\\xa0Michael Jackson.[5]\\xa0In another scene,\\xa0Ned Flanders\\xa0is seen wearing his \"Assassin\"\\xa0running shoes\\xa0from the season-two episode \"Bart\\'s Dog Gets an\\xa0F\".[12]\\xa0The flyer Homer replaces with the \"lost pet\" notice is\\xa0Principal Skinner\\'s \"Have you seen my body?\" flyer from \"Bart the Murderer\".[6][12]\\xa0Lisa references Richard Nixon\\'s dog Checkers. Also, among the books that end up in the Simpsons\\' fireplace are\\xa0The Lottery\\xa0by\\xa0Shirley Jackson,\\xa0Fahrenheit 451\\xa0by\\xa0Ray Bradbury,\\xa0Fatherhood\\xa0by\\xa0Bill Cosby, and a book entitled\\xa0Canine Surgery.\\xa0Fatherhood\\xa0was heavily referenced in the episode \"Saturdays of Thunder\" earlier this season.

The film uses footage of a kind that would aggravate a dog: a dog being hit with a rolled-up newspaper, a shoe kicking a water dish, a kitten playing with a ball of string, a tank running over a doghouse, a dog being hit on the head by a falling toilet seat, and finally \"footage\" of\\xa0Lyndon Johnson\\xa0holding his dog up in the air by the ears (which really happened).[15]\\xa0Music from\\xa0Peter and the Wolf, a children\\'s story composed by\\xa0Sergei Prokofiev, is played over the wanderings of Santa\\'s Little Helper through Springfield\\'s outer domains. This episode also references several controversies about Michael Jackson; for example, Kent Brockman\\'s butler tells Kent that his pet\\xa0llama\\xa0bit\\xa0Ted Kennedy, and Mr. Burns is sleeping in an\\xa0iron lung\\xa0as part of his longevity treatment.[16]\\xa0This episode shows the first time someone other than Homer says \"D\\'oh!\"\\xa0– Lisa, when she is assigned to do a report on\\xa0Nicolaus Copernicus\\xa0and realizes she does not have any\\xa0reference books.[17]\\xa0One of the places to where Santa\\'s Little Helper voyages, Swartzwelder County, where he rescues a baby from a burning house, is a reference to the writer of this episode, John Swartzwelder.[6]\\n',\n",

       "  'Since airing, \"Dog of Death\" has received positive reviews from television critics. Tom Adair of\\xa0The Scotsman\\xa0considers it to be a classic episode of the show,[25]\\xa0and Mark Zlotnick of\\xa0UGO\\'s DVDFanatic named it one of his personal favorites from season three.[26]\\xa0The episode\\'s reference to\\xa0A Clockwork Orange\\xa0was named the 10th-greatest film reference in the history of the show by\\xa0Total Film\\'s Nathan Ditum.[27]\\xa0Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed rated \"Dog of Death\" a\\xa03 (of 5) and commented that people who like dogs will enjoy the episode, in part because of Mr. Burns\\' attack-dog training program, which Meyers called a \"brilliant reference to\\xa0A Clockwork Orange\". He added that the episode is unlikely to satisfy devoted fans, and the relationship between the family and Santa\\'s Little Helper will not \"register\" to casual viewers; \"Still, there are enough laughs (especially in the animal hospital) to keep the audience entertained.\"[28]\\n',\n",
       "  'DVD Movie Guide\\'s Colin Jacobson also praised the parody of\\xa0A Clockwork Orange, describing it as \"possibly the funniest\\xa0Clockwork Orange\\xa0parody I\\'ve ever seen\". Jacobson added that the episode as a whole offers \"a terrific program. [...] From the cracks about the lottery and public hysteria that open the program to the calamities that befall the family when Santa\\'s Little Helper gets sick to the bizarre escapades that greet the pooch when he splits, \\'Dog of Death\\' provides a hilarious piece.\"[29]\\n',\n",
       "  'The authors of the book\\xa0I Can\\'t Believe It\\'s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, praised several scenes from the episode, including Homer\\'s dream of winning the lottery, Mr. Burns\\' brainwashing of Santa\\'s Little Helper, and the closing line of the episode that \"No dogs were harmed in the filming of this episode. A cat got sick, and someone shot a duck. But that\\'s it.\"[9]\\n',\n",
       "  'Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict commented that Santa\\'s Little Helper\\'s \"twisted stomach means the family must budget themselves to pay for the surgery, and the results are some of the best lines in the history of the show. From \\'lousy chub night\\' to \\'mmmm, snouts,\\' the hard knock life seems to enliven Homer into one sarcastic bastard.\"[30]\\xa0In 2007, Mikey Cahill of the\\xa0Herald Sun\\xa0named this episode\\'s chalkboard gag, \"I saw nothing unusual in the teacher\\'s lounge\", the third-best chalkboard gag in the show\\'s history.[4]\\n',\n",
       "  'While reviewing the episode in 2011,\\xa0Nathan Rabin\\xa0of\\xa0The A.V. Club\\xa0noted, \"perhaps because he\\'s a fucking dog, Santa\\'s Little Helper is never developed as fully as the other characters, so the requisite episode-ending orgy of sentimentality when Santa\\'s Little Helper is joyously reunited with Bart feels a little cheap and unearned.\"[31]\\n'],\n",

Mike Reiss, show runner of The Simpsons with Al Jean at the time, said Meyer wrote most of the episode by himself without help from the show\\'s other writers. Few changes were made to the first draft that he pitched to the producers; it was near identical to the final script.[1] The episode was inspired by the vocational tests taken by several members of the show\\'s staff when they went to school; Reiss, for example, said he was told he would become a librarian.[1] Jean said \"one of the first things that sold us on doing the episode\" was the idea of Bart becoming a policeman. He said it was \"a funny, realistic depiction of what a kid like Bart might wind up to become, and it wasn\\'t something you would immediately think of\".[2] Jean said the episode deals with the emotion that many adults feel when they grow older and realize they are not going to achieve the dreams they once had. \"[It\\'s about] how people in life cope with that problem. Maybe Lisa, at eight years old, is a little bit young to worry about that, but that\\'s what we were trying to explore here.\"[2]\\n',\n",

Series creator Matt Groening said he and some of the writers who were old enough to remember Allen\\'s TV show from the 1950s–60s were thrilled to have him guest-star, especially John Swartzwelder.[3] It took nine takes for Allen to pronounce Bart\\'s catchphrase \"¡Ay, caramba!\" correctly, to the point where the staff began to get slightly frustrated with him.[1] There was a discussion amongst the writing team of whether the episode should end with a joke or have a \"sweet\" ending. Reiss said \"With the better angels in our nature, we went with the sweet ending [of Lisa playing her saxophone for Bart].\"[1]\\n',\n",

Alf Clausen, a composer on The Simpsons who had previously worked on several police shows, wrote the music for the scene.[2] In another reference to The Streets of San Francisco and other Quinn Martin productions, a voice-over and caption proclaims the name of act two of the episode, \"Act II - Death Drives a Stick\", after the episode\\'s first act break in the middle of the Snake car chase.[1][6] In the sequence where Bart imagines himself testifying in court, his face is obscured with a blue dot; this is a references to the television coverage of the rape trial of William Kennedy Smith, in which the woman who accused Smith of raping her was obscured with a blue dot over her face.[1] The way the scene changes from Bart and Skinner talking in Skinner\\'s office to them searching through the lockers is a reference to the same style of scene change used in the 1960s Batman television series, in which a close-up of Batman\\'s face with dramatic music in the background is shown for a brief moment before the scene changes.[2] The song heard when Bart and Skinner search through the lockers for the Teachers\\' Editions is a variation of Harold Faltermeyer\\'s \"Axel F\" from the film Beverly Hills Cop.[1]\\n',\n",

In his book The Small Screen: How Television Equips Us to Live in the Information Age, Brian L. Ott describes this scene as one of the \"key ways The Simpsons appeals to audience, which tends to be younger, by critiquing authority figures, and in particular educators\".[7] Toby Daspit and John Weaver write in their book Popular Culture and Critical Pedagogy: Reading, Constructing, Connecting that the writers of The Simpsons are \"particularly interested\" in questions about authority and the abuses of powers in school. Another scene from the episode sees Ms. Hoover telling the students to stare at the blackboard for fifteen minutes until class is over. Daspit and Weaver write that it is \"the absolute power that teachers have over students\\' every action that allows for the image to be presented on The Simpsons. It would be comforting to tell ourselves that this is simply parody run amok, that the writers are stretching reality to make a point, but the discussants in the study [of The Simpsons in this book] had memories of a reality very much like the one presented in this program.\"[8] One of the discussants said she believes everyone has experienced similar situations in their school years, and she thinks the thought that \"an educator could ever do something so useless and pointless with the children\\'s time\" is \"frightening\".[8]\\n',\n",

He pitched the idea to the writers of the show, who suggested the parody of\\xa0Coal Miner\\'s Daughter\\xa0and also that Homer should become a manager for a country singer.[4]\\xa0Showrunner\\xa0Mike Reiss\\xa0was originally skeptical about the episode, as he did not think Homer could get a new job when he already had a full-time job at the\\xa0Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Reiss eventually gave in, but in future episodes the writers tried to develop the explanation that he got fired from the plant and then rehired at the end.[5]\\xa0Groening said that during the episode production, he received comments from the production team that Homer was acting like a \"jerk\" in it, but his explanation was that Homer\\'s behavior was due to his desire to make Lurleen a star and he was oblivious to her attempts to seduce him until the end.[4]\\xa0Mike Reiss stated that \"Whenever we want to write stories about characters getting divorced or actually having an affair, rather than with Homer and Marge, which we could never do, we use secondary characters for that.\"[This quote needs a citation]\\n',\n",
       "  'The episode\\'s director, Mark Kirkland, said he enjoyed directing the episode because the characters\\' emotions throughout it are \"very human and real\". He believed many viewers watching the episode would recognize the emotions from experiences in their own lives, and would feel sympathy for the characters.[6]\\xa0The idea of Homer annoying the people at the movie theater was based on an experience Groening had with a friend of his when he was younger. They were sitting by themselves in a movie theater and two \"annoying\" women sat down right in front of them. Groening\\'s friend told the women to move and they did. One of the women then turned to Groening and his friend and said, \"Now are you satisfied?\", to which Groening\\'s friend replied: \"I won\\'t be satisfied until I see you burn in hell.\"[4]\\n',\n",

She said the background designers \"must have gone on another field trip for this one\" because they captured the look of a typical musical recording studio. The recording studio in the episode, where Lurleen records her new songs with the Simpson family, features two rooms, one for the artist and one for the engineer, with a pane of glass between them. Cartwright said the designers added their own \"special touch\" by putting a few cracks on the walls, designing a slightly dilapidated ceiling, and by making it look as if the soundproofing on the walls is falling off.[13]\\xa0The\\xa0property designers\\xa0went on a field trip to\\xa0Sun Studio\\xa0to receive inspiration for the\\xa0props\\xa0in the recording studio, such as the \"in session\" red light, the mixing board, the musical instruments, and the volume-unit meters which indicate how loud the artist is singing.[13]\\xa0For the interior design of the recording studio, the color designers mixed colors such as orange, mauve, gray, and brown to make them complement each other. The colors in the engineer\\'s booth were darker to make Homer\\'s white suit stand out from the background.[13]\\xa0The appearance of the engineer at the recording studio was based on\\xa0John Boylan, an American music producer who produced the highly successful album\\xa0The Simpsons Sing the Blues.[13]\\xa0Lurleen\\'s mobile home was designed to be \"very confined\" and \"tiny\" so that the compositions of Homer and Lurleen would be tighter, thus giving the scene an intimate, romantic feeling.[6]\\n',\n",

Homer\\'s co-worker\\xa0Lenny\\xa0decides to give it a shot and sings \"There\\'s a Kind of Hush (All Over the World)\" to his bowling ball.[2]\\xa0Homer says that the last song before Lurleen\\'s \"Your Wife Don\\'t Understand You\" that he could not get out of his mind was the\\xa0Lipps Inc\\xa0song \"Funkytown\".[15]\\xa0The syndicated country comedy show that Lurleen appears on,\\xa0Ya-Hoo!, is based on the country television series\\xa0Hee Haw, which ran in syndication from 1971 to 1993.[1]\\n',\n",

Homer eventually settles for an airline pilots' bar, where he is mistaken for a pilot and put in the cockpit of an airplane, despite his vehement protests, which he promptly wrecks.

She uncovers the roots of Marge\\'s fear: the moment she realized her father was not a pilot, but a flight attendant. Her shame is eased when Zweig assures her that male flight attendants are now very common, and that her father could be considered a pioneer.

       "  'While having breakfast with her family, Lisa shows them her project for an upcoming science fair, a steroid-enhanced tomato she hopes will cure world hunger. At school, three days before the fair, Lisa leaves her tomato in Bart\\'s care for a moment and he hurls it at\\xa0Principal Skinner\\'s butt. When Lisa returns, she is furious. She asks\\xa0Marge\\xa0for help, who suggests she run a hamster through a maze. Lisa likes the idea, but instead pits a hamster against Bart to find out who is smarter. After two easy tests, the hamster leads two to zero. Bart later discovers her plans to humiliate him at the fair and pre-empts them with a project of his own, \"Can hamsters fly planes?\", showing her hamster in the cockpit of a miniature plane. Despite Lisa\\'s objection concerning the lack of scientific merit, everyone is distracted by how cute the hamster is, and a proud Skinner hands Bart the winning ribbon.\\n',\n",

Afterward, Homer refuses to let a drunk Barney drive home and forces him to hand over his keys. On their way out of the parking lot, their car is pulled over by police\\xa0Chief Wiggum, along with\\xa0Eddie and Lou. They administer a\\xa0breathalyser\\xa0test to Homer, which he fails. He is arrested, loses his license, and must attend traffic school and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. In bed, Marge gives Homer a magazine quiz about his drinking. Hearing Homer\\'s answers, Marge asks him to give up beer for a month, and he agrees to. He is kicked out of the Alcoholics Anonymous meeting when he admits to trying to eat the beer-stained dirt under the bleachers of a football stadium, but exhibits more positive changes like losing weight, saving over $100 and not sweating while eating. After thirty days of sobriety, despite many temptations, Homer goes back to Moe\\'s for a beer, but leaves after a steady, appraising look at Barney and the other barflies. He and Marge ride a bike into the sunset singing \"Raindrops Keep Fallin\\' on My Head\".\\n',\n",

Barlow incites Springfield\\'s residents to pressure Mayor Quimby into releasing Sideshow Bob. After his release, Bob becomes the Republican candidate for the Springfield mayoral election. Bart and Lisa attempt to prevent Bob\\'s election by aiding Quimby\\'s campaign. However, after Quimby falls ill after a meet-and-greet with senior citizens and takes a negligible amount of \\'extra drowsy\\' cold and flu medicine, he loses a mayoral debate and Bob wins in a landslide.\\n',\n",

Bart and Lisa suspect the election was rigged but are unable to find any proof. Waylon Smithers, who worked for Sideshow Bob's campaign but fears he will now be persecuted by the conservative mayor for his perceived homosexuality, tells them to find a voter named Edgar Neubauer. Having not found it in the library or the telephone directory, Bart finds the name on a tombstone at the cemetery. When he and Lisa check other names on voting rolls, they notice that most voters for Bob are long dead, including celebrities such as The Big Bopper and pet animals such as Lisa's beloved cat Snowball.\\n\",\n",

With all of his mayoral decisions nullified and reversed, the Simpsons' house is saved, the expressway is put on hold, Bart returns to his proper grade, and Quimby reclaims his job as Springfield's rightful mayor.\\n\",\n",

The episode also portrays Republicans as willing to break the law in order to achieve this; in this case, Bob commits electoral fraud. This is most displayed in Bob\\'s line: \"Your guilty conscience may force you to vote Democratic, but deep down inside you secretly long for a cold-hearted Republican to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king.

Other parts of the episode, such as the park\\'s claim to be the \"theme park of the future\" and the phrase \"where nothing can possibly go wrong,\" as well as the plot of the robots at the park rebelling, are based on another Crichton story, Westworld.[2][3] The Simpsons visit the fictional Five Corners in a brief scene while driving to Itchy & Scratchy Land. It is most likely based on the real USA attraction, the Four Corners, which contains Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico. \"Scratchtasia\" is a reference to the Sorcerer\\'s Apprentice segment of the Disney film Fantasia, with several shots and the music parodying it exactly.[3] In addition, the area where the cartoon \"Scratchtasia\" is being shown and the documentary it is a part of is reminiscent of the Great Movie Ride pre-show in MGM Studios at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. \"Pinnitchio\" is a parody of the 1940 Disney film Pinocchio. Homer and Marge dance at \\'T.G.I. McScratchy\\'s \"where it\\'s constantly New Year\\'s Eve\"; this is a parody of Pleasure Island at Walt Disney World where every night from 1990 through New Year\\'s Eve 2005 is celebrated as though it were New Year\\'s Eve. Hans Moleman being attacked by predatory birds while in the phone booth is a spoof of the 1963 Alfred Hitchcock film The Birds.[2] Walt Disney\\'s alleged antisemitism is spoofed in the character of Roger Meyers, Sr. in his cartoon Nazi Supermen Are Our Superiors.[3] The sound made by the vehicle that takes Bart to the detention facility resembles the one made by the ground shuttles carrying the fighter pilots inside the Rebel Base in the 1977 film Star Wars.[5] Marge\\'s Amish flashback recalls Peter Weir\\'s 1985 film Witness.[2]\\n',\n",

But later, at a union meeting,\\xa0Carl\\xa0announces that the newest contract requires them to give up their dental plan in exchange for a free keg of beer.

He invites Homer to his office with the intent of bribing him, but Homer misconstrues Mr. Burns\\' sly\\xa0innuendos\\xa0as\\xa0sexual advances. Homer declares that he is not interested in \"backdoor shenanigans\" and promptly leaves; Burns wrongly infers that Homer is honest and incorruptible.

At a later union meeting, Homer tries to resign, tired of meeting with Burns. The union misinterprets his frustration, and the members nearly unanimously decide to strike. Burns is undeterred by the strike and tries several methods of breaking it up, but fails.

Burns finally calls a meeting with Homer to concede their demands on one condition: that Homer resign as union president. Homer celebrates madly, leading Burns to finally realize that Homer is not the \"brilliant tactician\" he thought he was.

       "  '\"Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily\" was the first episode to be made after Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein became show runners of The Simpsons. They wanted to start the season with an episode centering on the Simpson family.[4] The story was pitched by writer George Meyer at a story retreat. Story retreats were held twice a year at a hotel room close to the studio lot, where all the writers gathered to pitch their ideas.[5] Seventeen episodes were pitched at this particular story retreat. Out of them all, Weinstein considered this episode to be the best, and he thought the pitch by Meyer was the best he had ever heard.[4] Oakley and Weinstein selected former full-time staff writer Jon Vitti to write the episode, wanting a \"heavy hitter\", since it was going to start the seventh production season. Vitti retained in his script most of what Meyer pitched at the retreat.[3]\\n',\n",

       "  'The episode was directed by Susie Dietter. A statue portraying The Simpsons writer John Swartzwelder stands outside the courthouse in the episode. Oakley said that this was a mistake because he and Weinstein thought that Springfield was located in Swartzwelder County, incorrectly going off a montage in the season three episode \"Dog of Death\". Said montage depicts Springfield as being located in Springfield County; Swartzwelder is the adjoining county.[3] The appearance of the female Child Protective Services agent is based on a disliked high school teacher both Oakley and Weinstein.[4] Cast member Hank Azaria\\'s voice for Cletus was slightly distorted in this episode because, over the summer between seasons, Azaria and the producers had forgotten what Cletus sounded like.[4]\\n',\n",

Realizing that no one will carry on his legacy when he dies, Mr. Burns decides to find an heir to inherit his vast fortune. After years of devotion, Smithers thinks he should inherit his wealth.

Bart and Lisa also audition and fail: Burns disqualifies Lisa because she is a girl and Bart because he dislikes the poorly worded proposal Homer makes him read aloud, which isn’t helped by Homer misspelling “Burns” as “Kurns” (and insisting that it is pronounced as such). The audition ends with Burns kicking him in the butt with a mechanical boot, much to Homer’s amusement. Homer then tells both Bart and Lisa to \"never try\". Bart gets revenge by vandalizing his mansion. Burns is impressed by Bart\\'s malevolence and accepts him as his heir, although he initially liked Nelson for a similar reason.\\n',\n",

Initially repelled by Burns\\' coldness, Bart warms to him after he promises to give him anything he wants. Soon Bart abandons his family because Burns allows him to do whatever he likes (including getting Krusty the Clown delivering him pizza while his show airs a rerun when Falkland islands were invaded). Bart\\'s parents sue to get their son back, but after they hire Lionel Hutz as their lawyer, the court decides that Burns is \"clearly the boy\\'s biological father.\" The Simpsons hire a deprogrammer to kidnap Bart, but he abducts Hans Moleman by mistake and brainwashes him into thinking he is the Simpsons\\' son.\\n',\n",

Lenny is the first employee to suffer this fate, having been forced to defend his record as an employee without using the letter \"E\". When Homer enters the office (through tracking a trail of donuts), Burns tries to completely sever Bart\\'s family ties by forcing him to fire his father. Instead, Bart \"fires\" Burns by dropping him through the trapdoor. Smithers quickly jumps into the shaft and implores his boss to \"land on Leonard\\'s carcass\" to cushion his fall.

Jim Reardon was the director.[1][3]\\xa0The episode is presented in a similar format to the previous season\\'s \"Treehouse of Horror\", and contains several similarities to the previous episode, such as Marge\\'s opening warning, the tombstones in the opening credits and the appearance of the alien characters\\xa0Kang and Kodos. \"Treehouse of Horror II\" was the first episode that employed the \"scary names\" idea, in which many of the names in the opening and closing credits have unusual nicknames. The idea came from Al Jean, who was inspired by old issues of\\xa0EC Comics.[4]\\xa0Although the names quickly became more silly than scary, there has been a wide variety of special credits. For example, the director\\'s name is given as Jim \"Rondo\" Reardon, a reference to his idol,\\xa0Rondo Hatton.[5]\\xa0The \"scary names\" became such a burden to write that they were cut for \"Treehouse of Horror XII\" and \"Treehouse of Horror XIII\", but after hearing complaints from the fans, Jean decided to bring them back.[4]\\xa0The alien characters Kang and Kodos had been introduced in the previous year. There was a debate about whether to include them in all Halloween specials after the episode; eventually, the writers agreed to make it a tradition.[6]\\n',\n",
       "  'During the beginning of the segment \"The Monkey\\'s Paw\",\\xa0Hank Azaria\\xa0faked some Arabic. Usually, the writers get inspiration for the Halloween specials from old horror stories, but recently, the writers tried to conceive of their own stories instead of creating more parodies.[7]\\xa0Also, when the Moroccan salesman tries to warn Homer Simpson, saying \"You\\'ll be sorry\", the animators forgot to move his lips. They realized their error only after the broadcast.[8]\\xa0While writing the segment, Sam Simon, one of the writers, wanted the fingers to go down in such an order so they would eventually have the\\xa0middle finger sticking up. Once the animation would have been complete, however, they could not have gone through; Fox would have refused to air the episode. They had considered the alternative of deliberately blurring the middle finger themselves, but decided that Fox would have also refused.[9]\\xa0For this episode, there were a lot of loop lines; for instance, the ending to \"The Monkey\\'s Paw\" was added to the last second. As a result of the loop, they still retained Flanders\\'s old house next to his newly created castle. In order to make the episode fill the time needed, the animators often extended the laughing time for Kang and Kodos.[9]\\n',\n",

The animators decided to make the animation a bit more impressive, and decided to do the concave and convex images of Burns and Smithers. Even though it was tough and took up more time, the producers felt it was a necessary tour-de-force.[3]\\xa0Originally, Homer's robotic voice was done post-animation in order to avoid stress on the voice actor. Then-head writer Jay Kogen, who created the Davy Crockett joke, thought it was so funny he actually mimicked the actions of Mr. Burns putting on Homer's brain in the writing room; the producers thought it was hilarious, so they decided to add it into the episode.[3]\\n\",\n",

       "  'The episode\\'s principal idea came from the season four episode \"The Front\", which contained a short sequence entitled The Adventures of Ned Flanders, featuring its own title card and theme song, at its conclusion. The scene has no relevance to the main plot of the episode and was designed solely as filler to accommodate the episode\\'s short runtime.[3] [4] The staff loved the concept and attempted to fit similar scenes into other episodes, but none were short enough to require one. Show runners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein decided to make an entire episode of linked short scenes involving many of the show\\'s characters, in a similar style to Quentin Tarantino\\'s Pulp Fiction.[3] The title \"22 Short Films About Springfield\" was decided upon from the start of the episode\\'s production,[3] even though there are not actually twenty-two stories in it.[5] Originally there were more scenes, but several of them had to be cut out for time.[3] To decide who would write each of the segments, all of the writers chose their top three favorite characters and put them into a hat, the names were drawn out and the writers were assigned their parts.[3] Oakley wrote the Superintendent Chalmers story,[3] Weinstein did the Comic Book Guy and Milhouse scene,[5] David Cohen penned the Reverend Lovejoy sketch, as well as the deleted Krusty the Clown scene.[6] Brent Forrester wrote the Krusty Burger scene,[5] while Rachel Pulido wrote the Bumblebee Man one.[3] Richard Appel wrote a deleted \"elaborate fantasy segment\" revolving around Marge, the only remnant of which is her cleaning the sink during the first Lisa scene, and also a scene with Lionel Hutz that was dropped.[7]\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n',\n",
       "  \"The episode's first draft was 65 pages long and needed to be cut down to just 42, so numerous scenes were cut for time or because they did not fit into the overall dynamic of the episode.[3] To solve this problem, a scene before the second act break, where the townspeople go to the Simpson house to provide advice of how Lisa can get the gum out of her hair, was created to include every character that did not appear anywhere else during the course of the episode.[3] Weinstein and writing supervisor Greg Daniels were responsible for ordering and linking together the episodes, and director Jim Reardon had the challenge of segueing between each section in a way that did not make the change seem abrupt.[8] Those that were hard to link were put before or after an act break or were given a theme song, one of which was cut from the Apu story, but was included as a deleted scene on The Complete Seventh Season DVD.[5]\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\n',\n",
       "  'Bill Oakley wrote the Chalmers scene because he is his all-time favorite character from the show. The main reason he loved him was that, until Frank Grimes was created for the season eight episode \"Homer\\'s Enemy\", Chalmers was the only character that \"seemed to operate in the normal human universe\".[3] In previous episodes, Skinner and Chalmers\\' scenes together revolved around one joke: Skinner tells Chalmers an unbelievable lie, but Chalmers believes him anyway. So, their scene in this episode is made up of a string of thirteen interconnected lies.[3] The dialogue between him and Skinner was something that had never been done before, in that it is just a long relaxed conversation with nothing important being said at all.[6] The idea behind the scene was to make fun of the classic sitcom trope of taking the boss home for dinner, the boss doubting his employee\\'s lies and ultimately believing them. Oakley wrote all the scene in one afternoon and the finished product resembles almost exactly its first draft. Layout artist Sarge Morton was given the task to storyboard the whole scene, as he had an affinity for scenes featuring both Skinner and Chalmers.[9]\\n',\n",

To maintain accuracy, the writers used a 19th-century slang thesaurus to look up words.[5] Many of the Spanish words used in Bumblebee Man's segment are easily understood cognates of English and not accurate Spanish; this was done deliberately so that non-Spanish speakers could understand the dialogue without subtitles.[5][10] The very tall man was a caricature of writer Ian Maxtone-Graham,[5] and the crowd on the street who laugh at Nelson includes caricatures of Matt Groening, Bill Oakley, and Josh Weinstein. Oakley wrote in the script that the street was filled with Springfield's biggest idiots; the animators drew him, Weinstein, and Groening into the scene.[3]\\n\",\n",

Snake runs over Wiggum at a red light, alluding to the segment of the film where the character of Butch Coolidge did the same to Marsellus Wallace, before crashing into a fire hydrant and beginning an on-foot chase.[5][11] The two run into Herman\\'s Military Antique shop, where Herman beats, ties up and gags the two, then waits for \"Zed\" to arrive, exactly as Maynard does in Pulp Fiction.[1][11] The Cheese brand \"Cheesy does it\" is a play on the album name \"Eazy-Duz-It\".The writers were pleased that Herman already existed as otherwise they would have had to create another character just for this scene.[3] The episode\\'s title is a reference to the film Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould.[1]\\n',\n",

Brooks \"didn\\'t go for it\".[9] The idea never resulted in anything, as Groening realized that the staff did not have the manpower to produce another show as well as The Simpsons.[24][25] By 2006, the staff maintained that it was something that they would still be interested in doing,[5] and by 2007 that it \"could happen someday\".[25] \"22 Short Films About Springfield\" also helped inspire the Futurama episode \"Three Hundred Big Boys\".[6]\\n',\n",

Unable to stay home with Marge because school forms state that homemaker is not a \"real job\", Bart goes to the DMV with Patty and Selma, and Lisa goes to the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant with Homer. At the DMV, Bart makes himself a fake driver\\'s license, which he, Nelson, Martin, and Milhouse use to rent a car. They include Martin in their plans after learning that he earned some money by investing in shares.\\n',\n",

After travelling aimlessly for a while, they decide to use the rented car for a road trip to the World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee. Once they arrive, they discover the fair was held fourteen years earlier; all that remains is a wig outlet. The boys each buy a wig and Martin spends the last of their money on an Al Gore doll. When Nelson accidentally knocks the Sunsphere (renamed the Wigsphere) on their car, crushing it, they are left stranded.\\n\",\n",

However, as he fails to earn enough money to get home and as none of his assignments get him anywhere near Springfield (his first involving flying organ transplants to Hong Kong), Bart again asks Lisa for help. After making Homer promise he will not get upset, Lisa reveals Bart's predicament. To get Bart home, Homer orders equipment for the power plant from Oak Ridge, Tennessee, pouring cola over his work station in order to justify it. He ships it from nearby Knoxville, with Bart as the courier and the boys stowed inside the crate.\\n\",\n",

Bill Oakley, the show runner of The Simpsons at the time, said that road trips were something that the writers liked to write stories about. The idea of four children going on a road trip was \"so exciting\" that they immediately knew they wanted to write it. There was a debate over where the children would go, and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was first suggested, but the writers eventually decided to have them go to a \"funny unlikely place\".[4] Oakley\\'s show runner partner, Josh Weinstein, said that the writers were always looking for combinations of characters that had not been done many times on the show.

At the time, The Simpsons was using traditional animation without computers, but they had to get one for a scene where the camera spins around the car from above.[6] The car was difficult to animate because it had to \"look real\" and not \"boxy like a truck\". The car was based on a 1993 Oldsmobile car with rounded edges.[5] The Simpsons animator David Silverman said that the episode was \"probably the most difficult one\" Scott had to direct on the show.[6]\\n',\n",

They start by telling Skinner how to get out of the Army: by violating Don\\'t Ask, Don\\'t Tell.

Bart and Skinner share a friendly chat about their typically antagonistic relationship and affectionately hug each other. During their hug, Bart tapes a \"Kick Me\" sign on Skinner\\'s back; Skinner tapes a \"Teach Me\" sign on Bart. The two chuckle to themselves as they walk away.\\n',\n",

Club, Mantegna said he thinks the reason he got the role was partly due to his performance in the 1990 Mafia film\\xa0The Godfather Part III, which had opened just prior to the offer. He thought the script was smart and clever, and he enjoyed recording it. Mantegna has since appeared many times on the show as Fat Tony, who became a recurring character; it is Mantegna\\'s longest-running role in his acting career.[4]\\xa0Mantegna commented: \"Who knew that Fat Tony was gonna resonate in the hearts and minds of the [Simpsons\\xa0fans] out there? Apparently [the writers] got enough feedback as to how the character was liked that they wrote it in again and again, and I was kind of a recurring guy that they\\'d tap into at least a couple episodes a season.\"[5]\\n',\n",

After Homer ignores official advice to remain indoors in order to buy beer, he comes face-to-face with the bear after failing to get into his car via the power line, whereupon the police subdue the bear (and Barney Gumble, accidentally) with a tranquilizer dart. Despite bears being a rare sight in Springfield, Homer leads a march of angry citizens to city hall, where they demand Mayor Quimby do something to protect them from bears. After Quimby deploys a bear patrol, which involves the use of high tech vehicles, including B2 Spirit aircraft, Homer is angry to learn his taxes have increased by $5 to maintain it. Another crowd of angry citizens marches to the mayor's office demanding lower taxes. To appease them, Quimby blames the higher taxes on illegal immigrants. He creates Proposition 24, which will force all illegal immigrants in Springfield to be deported.\\n\",\n",

Apu fears that if Proposition 24 passes, he will be forced to leave the United States, since his visa originally issued for his computer science studies expired many years before. After blackmailing Kearney when he attempts to buy beer using a fake ID, Apu visits Fat Tony to obtain false citizenship. At Tony's urging, Apu pretends to be an American citizen, even speaking in a faux American accent, but soon feels guilty about committing fraud and abandoning his Indian heritage, and destroys his fake passport.\\n\",\n",

Lisa discovers that Apu, as a long-term resident in the U.S., will not have to leave if he passes a citizenship test. Homer agrees to tutor Apu, but is unable to teach him accurate facts regarding U.S. history or political science needed to pass the exam. After falling asleep whilst studying and subsequently forgetting everything Homer taught him, Apu passes the test and becomes a US citizen. At a congratulatory party, Homer tells his guests deporting immigrants is awful because they help the country thrive. He inspires them to vote no on Proposition 24, but it still passes with 95% of the vote. When Proposition 24 is enacted, Groundskeeper Willie is the only resident deported.\\n',\n",

       "  '\"Much Apu About Nothing\" was written by David S. Cohen and directed by Susie Dietter.[1] Joe Mantegna guest stars in the episode as Fat Tony.[2] Much of the inspiration for the episode came from news reports of bears roaming streets in Southern California around the time when the episode was in production.[3] Cohen said that when a bear swims in somebody\\'s pool or goes in somebody\\'s garbage can, it becomes a popular news item in California.[4] The show runner of The Simpsons at the time, Bill Oakley, commented that the news reports often create an anti-bear hysteria, and that is one of the inspirations for the episode.[3]\\n',\n",

       "  'Another inspiration for the episode came from California\\'s Proposition 187, which proposed the rescinding of employment rights and benefits from illegal immigrants.[2] Cohen decided to name the referendum \"Proposition 24\" because 24 was the number he had on his Little League Baseball uniform. Cohen commented that \"the main theme of the episode is illegal immigration and anti-immigration sentiment, which is a big issue here in California. So both the intro with the bear and the main theme are yanked from the California headlines.\"[4]\\n',\n",

Oakley commented that some writer\\'s scripts get rewritten many times but Cohen\\'s \"usually do not get rewritten that much because they are so good\".

Some questions asked in the courses include: \"What aspects of American society are being addressed in the episode? What aspects of them are used to make the points?

They realized they needed help with the layouts and started giving various animators small parts to work on without telling them who the culprit was.[9] The table read for the episode also ended before the third act.[11] The writers had wanted the clues that were animated to be just right, so there were many animation retakes.[11] Oakley and Weinstein were initially unsure about having Maggie as the culprit, and it was decided that the episode would end with Maggie shifting her eyes and making it look like it was not a complete accident.[11]\\n',\n",

Due to contest regulations, a winner had to be selected out of a random sample of entries, whether the entries contained correct responses or not. The sample did not contain any correct answers, and so a winner (who had the wrong answer) was chosen at random.

They realized they needed help with the layouts and started giving various animators small parts to work on without telling them who the culprit was.[9] The table read for the episode also ended before the third act.[11] The writers had wanted the clues that were animated to be just right, so there were many animation retakes.[11] Oakley and Weinstein were initially unsure about having Maggie as the culprit, and it was decided that the episode would end with Maggie shifting her eyes and making it look like it was not a complete accident.[11]\\n',\n",

Due to contest regulations, a winner had to be selected out of a random sample of entries, whether the entries contained correct responses or not. The sample did not contain any correct answers, and so a winner (who had the wrong answer) was chosen at random.

Cohen could not concentrate on his task because he was waiting for lunch, and on the back of the script he scribbled, \"Lisa becomes a vegetarian?\".

Writer/showrunner Al Jean stated that because Homer is an adult character, he has more depth to him and thus storyline possibilities. Showrunner David Mirkin commented: \"Bart, to write him accurately as a child, he can only have so much depth at a certain age. With Homer, we try to explore all levels of adulthood. There are just more places to go. Writing Homer properly is the trick, he\\'s our main rock of the whole series. Homer\\'s IQ is fairly flexible, he won\\'t necessarily understand how to open a door at some point, but he can name the Supreme Court justices. Finding that balance is key to making the show work and making it surprising and making it believable and emotionally grounded.\"[2] Mirkin was very fond of the fact that Homer and Marge have the biggest fight they have ever had on the show in the episode, and he thought it was a \"really great\" exploration of their marriage. He noticed that because Homer is thrown out of the house, the audience really worry about their relationship.

       "  'It was revealed in a flashback in the episode that Smithers was briefly married to a woman, but the two split up when he devoted too much time to his boss Mr. Burns. Smithers\\'s relationship with Mr. Burns has long been a running joke on The Simpsons. His sexual orientation has often come into question, with some fans claiming he is a \"Burns-sexual\" and only attracted to his boss, while others maintain that he is, without a doubt, gay.[6][7] Matthew Henry wrote in the book Leaving Springfield that this episode is \"perhaps the best\" example of an attempt to portray an actual gay lifestyle on the show. Henry added that the flashback is a \"wonderfully rendered parody of scenes from two of Tennessee Williams\\'s most famous plays, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and A Streetcar Named Desire. To fully appreciate it, one must know something of not only the two plays cited but also of Williams himself, of his own struggles with both heterosexual and homosexual desires and the way in which these struggles were incorporated into his art. The creators of The Simpsons offer what I think is a perfect parallel for the relationship between Smithers and Mr. Burns by combining Williams\\'s two most notable male characters and their defining characteristics: the suppressed homosexual desire of Brick and desperate dependence of Stanley.\"[8]\\n',\n",

The writers did not think The Simpsons was the right forum for it, so Daniels suggested the idea of selling someone\\'s soul, which originated in his childhood.[3] In high school, Daniels encouraged a bully to sell him his soul for 50 cents, and then convinced classmates to frighten the bully into buying his soul back for an inflated price. Daniels repeated this ploy, but stopped when he realized that the only other person in history who has profited off others\\' souls was Satan, and that \"scared\" him.[4] In the opening scene of the episode, the congregation of the First Church of Springfield are tricked into singing \"In a Gadda Da Vida\" by Iron Butterfly. Daniels had originally intended for the song to be \"Jesus He Knows Me\" by British rock band Genesis, but the producers were unable to obtain the rights for it to be featured in the episode.[4]\\n',\n",

Archer and his team of animators went to the restaurant chain Chili\\'s to get inspiration for the background designs of Moe\\'s family restaurant. He said it was \"quite a task\" to transform Moe\\'s Tavern into a family-oriented establishment. Archer added that he was not \"quite happy\" with the result, and that they could have designed it \"a little better\".[5] Weinstein recalled that there was contention between the animators about the way Moe looked in the episode. Moe\\'s original design includes a missing tooth, but Weinstein and Oakley felt that it did not \"look right\" because Moe was such a prominent character in the episode.[3] Archer showed the original design of Moe from the first season to the show runners, and said: \"Here, look. He\\'s got a missing tooth!\", but the scenes that had Moe with a missing tooth in them were still reanimated.[6] Archer was disappointed with the dream sequence in which Bart sees his friends playing with their souls. Archer said that he had forgotten to tell the animators to make the souls transparent, so they were painted blue instead.[5] George Meyer pitched the joke restaurant title \"The Texas Cheesecake Depository.\"[7]\\n',\n",

He juxtaposes this with Bart\\'s realization later in the episode that \"life suddenly feels empty and incomplete\" without a soul, which suggests \"either that the soul is real or it is at least a useful fiction\".[11] Mark I. Pinsky and Samuel F.

       "  '\"Lady Bouvier\\'s Lover\" was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and directed by Wes Archer.[1] The episode was inspired by the fact that The Simpsons has many elderly characters, which the writers felt was unique for network television, so they sought to highlight those characters. Originally, the episode was supposed to be about Misery. One of the ideas was that Grampa would get injured on Mr. Burns\\'s property and get stuck there, leading Grampa to think that Mr. Burns would kill him when he was discovered there. However, this idea was cut out in production because the script was over 85 pages long.[2]\\n',\n",

       "  'The episode was recorded at the Darryl F. Zanuck Building on the 20th Century Fox lot in West Los Angeles, where the cast and crew of The Simpsons gathered on a Monday morning in October 1993. Before the recording session took part, the main voice actors of the show (Dan Castellaneta, Harry Shearer, Julie Kavner, Yeardley Smith, Nancy Cartwright, and Hank Azaria) sat down with executive producer David Mirkin and a crew of writers at a table reading to determine what shape the script was in. There was \"genuine hearty laughter at various points\" during the script run-through, said Ray Richmond, a reporter for the Los Angeles Daily News. Immediately after the reading, the crew of writers hurried to make script changes based on what got laughs and what did not, while the actors waited impatiently. Mirkin told Richmond that the script would require the equivalent of ten rewrites: \"At every step, there are amendments and additions and refinements.\" Richmond commented that as the recording session started, the \"astounding versatility\" of the actors became clear; \"Castellaneta bounces from being Homer to Grampa to Barney without taking a breath and minus any evident vocal similarities.\"[3] Mirkin said the episode was also a tour de force for Kavner, who in one scene voices Marge, Marge\\'s two sisters, and Marge\\'s mother. He added that even though she enjoyed the process, it was tough on Kavner\\'s voice because those characters talk with \"gravelly voices\".[4]\\n',\n",

Grampa banging on the church window while shouting \"Mrs. Bouvier!\", and the subsequent getaway on the bus, are references to the film The Graduate, as is the closing song, a parody of \"The Sound of Silence\" by Simon and Garfunkel.[6] Mrs. Bouvier says her friends, Zelda Fitzgerald, Frances Farmer and Sylvia Plath, were jealous of her good looks and it drove them crazy. All three women were known for having been institutionalized, Fitzgerald and Farmer for schizophrenia and Plath for a breakdown that resulted in suicide.[5] Mrs. Bouvier\\'s favorite tune—played during the dance at the Springfield Community Center and later by Grampa at the wedding—is Glenn Miller\\'s song \"Moonlight Serenade\". The swing tune played during Mrs. Bouvier and Mr. Burns\\'s dance is the 1936 song \"Sing, Sing, Sing\", written by Louis Prima and performed by Benny Goodman.[1] Bart and Lisa sing the 1960s advertising jingle used for Armour and Company\\'s brand of hot dogs.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 19, 1996. In the episode, Homer is shocked to find classic rock is no longer considered cool. Hoping to earn \"street cred\", he joins the Hullabalooza music festival as a carnival freak. The episode\\'s title is a play on the Lollapalooza music festival. It was the last Simpsons episode written by Brent Forrester and the last one directed by Wes Archer (both Forrester and Archer left to work on King of the Hill).[1] Peter Frampton and musical groups Sonic Youth, Cypress Hill and The Smashing Pumpkins guest star as themselves.\\n',\n",

After being tossed out by the crowd, Homer angrily kicks a cannon, which shoots one of Peter Frampton's inflatable pigs at his stomach. The festival head is impressed by Homer's ability to absorb cannon fire and hires him for the festival's freak show (played by the Jim Rose Circus), called the pageant of the transmundane.\\n\",\n",

Homer decides to perform his act one last time, but he dodges the cannonball at the last second.

       "  'During their tenure as executive producers of The Simpsons, Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein tried to include one episode related to The Itchy & Scratchy Show in every season.[4] \"The Day the Violence Died\", written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Wes Archer,[1] was The Itchy & Scratchy Show-related episode for the seventh season, and became a vehicle for jokes about animation.[5] After completing the episode, Oakley commented, \"This episode is one of the craziest episodes ever, I would dare say. It is so packed with references and inside jokes and the ending is so bizarre that a lot of people didn\\'t understand it.\" The episode was considered polarizing. In one of its jokes, Bart asks Homer for a large sum of money and Homer immediately pulls out his wallet. Oakley described the scene as \"very controversial\" among the show\\'s producers; Matt Groening, the creator of The Simpsons, in particular did not like it.[4]\\n',\n",

       "  'In Swartzwelder\\'s original script, the \"Amendment to Be\" segment was a cartoon called Homage Alley that was consciously a parody of the humor style of The Simpsons, but the producers felt that it was not funny.[6] As a result, it was replaced by the \"Amendment to Be\" cartoon, which is a parody of the \"I\\'m Just a Bill\" segment of the educational television series Schoolhouse Rock. Worried about potential lawsuits, the lawyer of The Simpsons made the animators change the design of the senator in the segment. Weinstein did the voice of the \"Curly amendment\" in the segment, claiming the other voice actors \"couldn\\'t do it exactly right.\"[7] The end of the episode features Lester and Eliza, who save Itchy & Scratchy Studios. Bart and Lisa typically solve problems in the show, but the writers decided to try something different and have a new pair of characters take their positions. Lester\\'s design is a slightly altered version of Bart\\'s design in The Tracey Ullman Show and is voiced by Tress MacNeille, who normally voices Bart on temporary tracks.[4]\\n',\n",

William Hickey, not Douglas, was the producers\\' first choice for the role, who they described as \"famous for being a grouchy, mean old man\". Oakley and Weinstein, who often search for \"the absolutely perfect voice\" when looking for guest stars rather than simply using celebrities, felt that Hickey\\'s gruff raspy voice would be perfect for the role, but he turned them down.[4] In Nancy Cartwright\\'s autobiography My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy, she comments that the episode\\'s script was a \"gem\" and recalls that Kirk Douglas\\'s recording session, directed by Josh Weinstein, was fraught with interruptions. He refused to wear the earphones supplied to him in the recording studio, saying they hurt his ears, so he was unable to hear Weinstein from his booth. Cartwright directed Douglas, who was in a hurry and said that he would do two takes per line at the most. However, despite reading his lines all at once, he only had trouble with one scene; the scene in which Lampwick tells Bart he created Itchy & Scratchy required three takes, as Douglas continuously misread the line \"I changed all that\" as \"I charged all that\". Cartwright managed to get him to do a third reading of the line by pretending to sneeze during his second take.[8]\\n',\n",

Roger Meyers, Jr. was voiced by Alex Rocco, who also voiced the character in the episode \"Itchy & Scratchy & Marge\"; while the character had reappeared in several episodes, in those instances he was voiced by Hank Azaria.[4] The episode also stars Pamela Hayden and Tress MacNeille, and Phil Hartman as lawyer Lionel Hutz.[2]\\n',\n",

When Roger Meyers Jr. pleads his case in court, he mentions that several animated television series and characters were plagiarized from other series and characters: \"Animation is built on plagiarism!

It expanded into a full song primarily concocted by George Meyer, who included \"corny\" aspects of vaudeville.[3][4] The line \"From chimpan-A to chimpan-Z\" in the final song of the musical was written by David X. Cohen. Oakley commented that he has heard the line \"all over the world\".[3] Several of the staffers have commented on how writing the Planet of the Apes parody generated a great deal of enthusiasm in the writer\\'s room: Oakley described it as \"one of those rare bursts of creative brilliance.

The devil, revealed to be Ned Flanders, appears and offers Homer a contract to seal the deal. However, before Homer finishes the donut, he realizes that Ned will not be able to have his soul if he does not eat all of the donut and keeps the final piece in the refrigerator. Unfortunately, while half-asleep and looking for a midnight snack, he eats the final piece of the \"forbidden donut\", and Ned instantly reappears to take possession of Homer\\'s soul. Marge and Lisa plead with Ned, finally getting him to agree to hold a trial the next day. Until then, Homer is sent to spend the rest of the day being punished in Hell. His first punishment is to be strapped down and force-fed \"all the donuts in the world!\" (a contrapasso[2]) but he eats them all eagerly. At the stroke of twelve midnight, Ned brings Homer back to the Simpson household for his trial. Then, when the Simpsons\\' lawyer, Lionel Hutz, flees after ruining his case, Marge makes a final effort to save Homer by displaying a photo from their wedding day. On the back of the photo, Homer has written that, in return for Marge giving him her hand in marriage, he pledges his soul to her forever; therefore, it was not his property to sell at the time of his deal with Ned. The jury rules in favor of the Simpsons and the presiding judge dismisses the case. Defeated and enraged, Ned frees Homer, but gets his revenge by turning Homer\\'s head into a donut. The next morning, Homer cannot stop eating his own head as the police eagerly wait for him (as their breakfast) to leave the house while holding cups of coffee.\\n',\n",

Bart panics when he sees a gremlin on the side of the bus loosening the lug nuts on one of the wheels and tries to convince the other passengers of the danger but nobody can see the gremlin (the aliens Kang and Kodos are then seen from their spaceship mocking the scene, stating Bart is \"frightened of a creature that doesn\\'t exist\" before laughing hysterically and then discovering an identical gremlin ripping bits and pieces out from their own spaceship). In desperation, Bart climbs halfway out the window to scare off the gremlin with an emergency flare. As Bart is pulled back into the bus by Skinner and Groundskeeper Willie, he drops the flare and by chance, it hits the gremlin, who catches fire and falls from the bus, but is found by Ned, who decides to adopt the creature. When the bus finally stops, everyone sees the obvious damage, but Bart is still sent away to an insane asylum for the rest of his life for his disruptive behavior. Bart is relieved as he is finally able to rest, but the gremlin appears in the back window of the ambulance, holding Ned\\'s decapitated (yet still living) head, which makes Bart scream in terror.\\n',\n",

The family is invited to Mr. Burns\\' castle in Pennsylvania for a midnight feast, where Bart and Lisa discover a secret staircase descending to an eerie basement filled with coffins. As they investigate, vampires emerge from the coffins and encircle them while Lisa reads through Mr. Burns autobiography \"Yes, I Am a Vampire\" (with a foreword by Steve Allen). Lisa escapes, but Bart activates the \"Super Fun Happy Slide\", causing him to slide back down into the vampire pit, whereupon he is captured and bitten by Mr. Burns. Lisa tries to warn her parents, but Burns reappears with Bart who is now very pale and is behaving oddly. But these factors get little attention by the family. Later that night, Lisa is awakened by a now undead Bart and his vampire friends outside the bedroom window, in an homage to Salem\\'s Lot. When Bart is about to bite Lisa, Homer and Marge interrupt and discover that Bart is a vampire. Lisa claims that the only way to restore him is to kill the head vampire, Mr. Burns. The family returns to Mr. Burns\\' mansion, where Homer drives a stake through Mr. Burns\\' heart (after first hitting his crotch), causing him to dissolve into sand (but not before Mr. Burns tells Homer \"You\\'re Fired!\"). The next morning, however, Lisa discovers that everyone else in the Simpson family is a vampire, with Marge as their head. The family closes in on Lisa, but instead of attacking, they break character and wish the home audience a happy Halloween.

       "  '\"Treehouse of Horror IV\" was directed by David Silverman and co-written by Conan O\\'Brien (his final assignment for The Simpsons; by the time this episode aired, his brand-new late night show on NBC had been on for a little over a month), Bill Oakley, Josh Weinstein, Greg Daniels, Dan McGrath, and Bill Canterbury. It is the fourth episode of the annual Treehouse of Horror Halloween specials.[1] As with the rest of the Halloween specials, the episode is considered non-canon and falls outside the show\\'s regular continuity. O\\'Brien worked on the \"wrap-arounds\" of Bart introducing each segment to make sure that they \"pulled\" the episode together.[3] The wrap-arounds are based on Rod Serling\\'s television series Night Gallery, in which Serling appears at an art gallery and introduces each episode by unveiling paintings depicting the stories. Executive producer James L. Brooks loved the show, so it was \"great fun\" for him to do the parody.[4] Show runner David Mirkin thought the Treehouse of Horror episodes were the hardest episodes to do because the staff had to fit in all three stories in only 22 minutes. Mirkin said, \"Things had to happen really fast. They\\'re really just crammed with jokes and story beats and everything.\"[5]\\n',\n",

       "  'The first segment, \"The Devil and Homer Simpson\", was written by Daniels and McGrath.[6] The first time Devil Flanders appears, he looks the same as the devil Chernabog from the 1940 Walt Disney produced film Fantasia; Silverman particularly admired the animation in that sequence.[7] Oakley loved the idea of Flanders being the Devil because he was the character whom viewers would least expect. He also thought Harry Shearer did a good job of playing Flanders in a much darker way, while remaining very true to the character.[8] Many scenes had to be cut to shorten the segment, including one that showed Homer\\'s severed head being used as a bowling ball by a demon in hell. This scene later appeared in the clip show episode \"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\", which aired in the show\\'s seventh season.[5]\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n',\n",
       "  'The second segment, \"Terror at 5+1⁄2 Feet\", was written by Oakley and Weinstein. It was inspired by an episode of The Twilight Zone called \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\", in which William Shatner\\'s character is inside an airplane watching a gremlin tear apart the wing. Silverman watched the episode to get inspiration for Bart\\'s facial expressions.[7] Oakley said there was a lot of work put into the design of the gremlin in \"Terror at 5+1⁄2 Feet\" to make him scary \"within The Simpsons universe\".[8] Mirkin said he felt the gremlin was well-done because he looked scary and \"yet it looks like a completely organic Simpsons character\". Üter, a character from Germany, makes his first appearance on the show in this segment; he was conceived as a one-time joke, but reappeared in later episodes because Mirkin felt he was \"such a perfect stereotype\".[5]\\n',\n",

       "  'The third segment, \"Bart Simpson\\'s Dracula\", was written by Canterbury. It is based on Francis Ford Coppola\\'s film Bram Stoker\\'s Dracula. Mirkin was a big fan of the film and pushed for a segment about vampires inspired by the movie. He liked the final result and felt Mr. Burns was perfect in the role of Dracula.[5] Dracula and his castle were designed by Silverman.

The scene in Hell where Homer is fed all the doughnuts in the world, and asks for more, is a direct parody of the cartoon Pigs is Pigs, in which the character Piggy (known for being a glutton) is taken in by a scientist and forced to eat all the food in the world.[7] In the school bus, Martin wears a shirt reading Wang Computers. At Mr. Burns\\' castle, Lisa notices a tome resting on a stand in the basement. She runs over and reads the title: \"Yes, I Am a Vampire, by Monty Burns. Foreword by Steve Allen,\" a reference to American actor Steve Allen.[5] Shortly after she finds the tome, she makes allusions to Shemp and Curly Howard of the Three Stooges, mistaking Bart\\'s fearful attempts at getting her attention as impressions of the two. Bart floating outside Lisa\\'s bedroom window is a parody of The Lost Boys as well as Stephen King\\'s novel Salem\\'s Lot. The family\\'s plan to kill the head vampire is also a reference to both the film and novel. In particular, the twist revelation that Burns is not the head vampire is also a reference to the twist ending of The Lost Boys.[7] The closing credits of the episode features a version of the Simpsons theme that is a combination of the instruments used in The Munsters theme song and the harpsichord and clicking from The Addams Family theme song.[5]\\n',\n",

They did not want Homer to come off as a \"hog\", so they decided that the viewer should barely see him eating after he reaches his 300 pounds goal.[2] As the writers were trying to figure out a way to get Homer back to his old weight by the end of the episode, it was suggested that Homer should feel bad about his obesity, and therefore become thin for Marge, but that idea was scrapped in early production.[2] Action figurines based on obese Homer were made for the World of Springfield in December 2001.[5]\\n',\n",

They are stranded with no food or water for several days; the Springfield Police Department refuses to search for them because their rescue boat is out of refreshments. The raft springs a leak after Homer accidentally drops a pocket knife he was intending to gift to Bart.

The staff liked his work on the films Marty and From Here to Eternity, so they asked him to do a guest appearance on the show. Borgnine felt he could not say no to the offer because his grandchildren were fans of the show.[3] In the final scene of the episode, Borgnine plays a guitar and sings campfire songs with the children. Borgnine was a guitar player in real life, so he brought his own guitar with him to the recording studio.[2] Borgnine apologized because he felt that he was not being able to sing very well, but Nancy Cartwright, who provides the voice of Bart, thought his voice \"added to the authenticity of his character\".[4] The Simpsons\\'s creator Matt Groening thought the recording sessions with Borgnine were \"so much fun\".[3] Hank Azaria, who provided the voice of Apu, commented that Borgnine \"had no idea what the hell he was doing. He\\'s a good actor, and he read his lines just fine, but he had no idea what the show was, no idea what we were doing.\"[5]\\n',\n",

Other games at the arcade include a game based on the 1984 film The Terminator.[1] The \"Springfield, Springfield\" number performed by Bart and Milhouse on their night out in town is a reference to the musical number \"New York, New York\" from the film On the Town, starring Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra.[1] During a scene in which Hans Moleman and Moe fight with knives, Hans tells Moe, \"You call that a knife? This is a knife!\", a reference to a line from the 1986 film \"Crocodile\" Dundee.[6] Ernest Borgnine introduces himself a la Troy McClure to the Junior Campers by recalling his role in From Here to Eternity, a film which modern children are unlikely to have seen. As Homer daydreams, he sings the song \"Sugar, Sugar\" by The Archies.[6] While on the raft, Homer misquotes lines from Samuel Taylor Coleridge\\'s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner when he says \"Water, water everywhere/So let\\'s all have a drink.\"[7] The scene in which Borgnine and the other rafters drift through a dark forest watched by mountain men is a reference to a scene in the 1972 film Deliverance, and the scene features the music from the film\\'s \"Dueling Banjos\" scene.[8] The unseen person or creature that attacks Borgnine at the end of the episode is implied to be Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th film series.[8]\\n',\n",

       "  '\"Bart the Fink\" was written by John Swartzwelder, but Bob Kushell came up with the idea for it. The episode was based on the \"big tax problems\" that some celebrities, such as country singer Willie Nelson, had at the time. The idea of Krusty faking his own death was an idea the production team had wanted to do for a long time, and it was inspired by the rumors that American actor Andy Kaufman had faked his death.[3] Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, the showrunners of seasons seven and eight of The Simpsons, came up with the beginning of the episode in which the family spends the night in a haunted house as the epitome of \"the cruddiest beginning of any cruddy thing\", but with the comedic twist that the family did not encounter any ghosts in the house and had their \"best night\\'s sleep ever\".[4] A similar joke (riffing on the cliched nature of the setup) was used in the season 5 episode, Homer Loves Flanders, with both episodes sharing the same haunted house model.\\n',\n",

Consultant David Mirkin suggested that the animators should add \"some funny things\" to the episode to \"spice it up\", such as the gorilla suit that one of the bank employees wear.[4] After the audio recording of the script by the cast, the episode ended up being too long. Weinstein said one of the reasons for it was that Krusty talks very slowly, which drags out the time. They were only allowed to send twenty minutes\\' worth of audio to Film Roman for them to animate, but the audio track for the episode was twenty-six minutes long.[4] American actor Bob Newhart guest-starred in the episode as himself. Oakley said Newhart also talked very slowly and they had to cut out more than half of his recorded lines.[3] Many of the writers were big fans of Newhart and everybody wanted to see him record his lines. Oakley and Weinstein decided to shut down production so that the whole writing staff could go to the recording studio. The episode was recorded in a large room, which required everybody there to be very quiet. It took Newhart two and a half minutes to record his first take, and, as no one was allowed to laugh during that time, there was an \"explosion\" of laughter in the room when he finished.[5] Parts of Phil Hartman\\'s appearance as Troy McClure were also cut from the episode due to time limits.[3]\\n',\n",

The \"way they radiate out\" had always amazed him.[3] Archer, who directed the animation of the episode, also thought they turned out well. The lights were especially hard for them to animate back then because the show was animated traditionally on cels, so Archer was pleased with the results.[4] A deleted scene from the episode shows Homer dealing cards to James Bond.

Groening had been told by a spokesperson that if he put Planet Hollywood in The Simpsons, the creators of the restaurant, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, and Sylvester Stallone, would agree to make guest appearances on the show. The writers of The Simpsons were excited about this so they wrote a new subplot for the episode that featured Planet Hollywood and the three actors. However, for unknown reasons, they were unable to appear in the episode.[6] Instead, Gerry Cooney and Robert Goulet guest starred as themselves. Executive producer David Mirkin enjoyed directing Goulet because he was \"such a good sport\" and had \"a great sense of humor\".[5] Oakley thought it was nice that Goulet was willing to make fun of himself in the episode, which at the time was rare for guest stars on The Simpsons.[3] This episode features the first appearances of Gunter and Ernst, the Siegfried and Roy-esque casino magicians who are attacked by their white tiger, Anastasia. Ten years after this episode first aired, Roy Horn was attacked by one of the duo\\'s white tigers. The Simpsons production team dismissed the novelty of the prediction by saying that it was \"bound to happen\" sooner or later.[5] The Rich Texan also makes his debut appearance in this episode, referred to as \"Senator\" by Homer.[1]\\n',\n",

Mirkin wanted to find out what would happen in a situation where Homer finds himself attracted to another woman. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening had previously written an episode for the show\\'s third season, called \"Colonel Homer\", where Homer finds himself attracted to a country singer named Lurleen Lumpkin. In that episode, Lurleen immediately had a \"crush\" on Homer, but Homer was not aware of it until later on. With this episode, Mirkin wanted Homer to immediately know he was attracted to Mindy.

He added that the two characters have \"so much in common\" that it is \"not just a physical relationship, but a mental connection as well\", and that Mindy is not a seductress but rather a woman just as nervous as Homer. Mirkin also pointed out that while Homer is being tempted by a \"seemingly perfect\" woman at work, his wife could not be more \"imperfect\" since she has got a cold and looks sick. \"He\\'s trying to connect with his family, but with Marge looking sick and Bart looking like a nerd, everything is just not working,\" Mirkin said.[3]\\n',\n",

When Pfeiffer entered the room with her daughter, Pfeiffer was \"mobbed\" by the energy of the writers and directors, who were excited to see her. Mirkin, who directed Pfeiffer in the studio, was nervous because he thought she was a beautiful woman who was on a \"completely different level\" than the other actors and actresses he had directed on the show. Pfeiffer was also nervous because she had never voiced an animated character. Mirkin told her: \"You\\'re gonna love this more than anything you have ever done because it\\'s calm and pleasant, and we have so much time to play and experiment.\" This helped her calm down and by the end of the session, she was \"really relaxed\" and they had a \"fantastic\" time.[3]\\n',\n",

Pfeiffer \"hit it really well\" and they did it several times to get it \"more and more real\". Mirkin also thought that Pfeiffer completely understood the part and played it perfectly. He described her as \"one of those actresses that you don\\'t even have to see to know they\\'re great, instead you can hear from her voice what a brilliant actress she is.\" Dan Castellaneta was also praised by Mirkin for his performance as Homer. Castellaneta struggled to be \"sweet\" and \"moving\" in his performance.[3]\\n',\n",

The angel initially takes the form of Isaac Newton, but since Homer has no idea who that is, instead takes the form of Colonel Klink, then shows Homer what his life would be like without Marge (in the style of It\\'s A Wonderful Life). Colonel Klink is a character on the American television series Hogan\\'s Heroes. Klink\\'s actor in Hogan\\'s Heroes, Werner Klemperer, provided the voice of Klink in this episode. Mirkin said Klemperer was a \"fantastic sport\" to do the character. Since Hogan\\'s Heroes had gone off the air in 1971, he had forgotten how to play Klink. Mirkin therefore had to do an impression of Klink that Klemperer could imitate to get it right.[3] This cameo was Klemperer\\'s last credited role before his death in 2000.[5]\\n',\n",

       "  'The title is a reference to the 1988 film \"The Last Temptation of Christ\". When Homer first meets Mindy, he imagines her as Venus in Sandro Botticelli\\'s painting The Birth of Venus.[1] To deal with Homer and Mindy charging room service to the company, Mr. Burns unleashes flying monkeys in the manner of the Wicked Witch of the West, as seen in the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. However, the attempt fails as the monkeys all fall to their deaths.[2] The scene where Homer meets his guardian angel in the guise of Isaac Newton (who changes into Colonel Klink from Hogan\\'s Heroes because Homer has no idea who Newton is), wondering what his life would have been like if he married Mindy and not Marge, draws from the films It\\'s A Wonderful Life and A Christmas Carol.[2] When Homer meets Mindy in the elevator, he thinks \"unsexy thoughts\" to avoid being seduced by her. He imagines Barney in a bikini and humming the theme tune to the American sitcom I Dream of Jeannie.[2] At home, Homer watches a TV show about the \\'secret affairs\\' of Kennedy, Eisenhower, Bush and Clinton. Homer attempts to read the notes for Mindy that he wrote on his hand, but they have smeared out because of sweat. In his attempt, Homer unknowingly babbles the Nam Myoho Renge Kyo, a Japanese Buddhist chant in Nichiren Buddhism and Soka Gakkai. This is a reference to an Akbar and Jeff cartoon, written by Matt Groening, in which the same mantra is used.[3] When Homer notices the sweat, he says he is \"sweating like [film critic] Roger Ebert\".[2] In the bathroom, Homer sings a rough version of the song \"Mandy\" by Barry Manilow, replacing \"Mandy\" with \"Mindy\"; when Homer panics upon realizing Lisa heard him singing and tries to cover the song up, Lisa glumly says \"It sounds like you\\'re infatuated with a woman named Mindy. (pause) Or a man named Andy.\"[2] Homer refers to comic strip Ziggy when he wonders if Mindy agrees the title character has become \"too preachy\".[1] Barry White\\'s song \"Can\\'t Get Enough of Your Love, Babe\" is played in the episode\\'s final scene where Homer and Marge make out at the hotel room.[6]\\n',\n",

It was the first full episode of the show that Daniels wrote.[1] The Simpsons writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who were show runners during the previous two seasons, came up with the idea for the episode. They left the idea with David Mirkin, who took over the job as show runner during this season. Mirkin said he was \"very excited and intrigued\" with the idea of the episode. Soon thereafter, he assigned Daniels to write the script because he knew that Daniels would \"step up\" and \"throw himself into it\".[2] In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Mirkin stated that when he took over the show, he wanted to \"bring it back\" to character and story; unlike the previous season, which got \"so fast-moving and so full of cutaway gags\". Mirkin added: \"I explored the characters a little more, took them a little further. I had one of the first episodes where Homer was really tempted by another woman, \\'The Last Temptation of Homer\\', and Bart having a girlfriend even nastier than himself, \\'Bart\\'s Girlfriend\\', plus more of a focus on side characters. We did the first episode to really feature Apu as a main character. Those were my goals.\"[3] Kirkland said he was grateful that he got to work with a \"wonderful crew\" on the episode, including Bob Anderson, who he thought was a \"wonderful\" director. Kirkland said that Anderson assisted him on the episode and did \"fine animation throughout\".[4]\\n',\n",

The story was therefore rewritten so that Woods received Apu\\'s job instead.[2] When the season was in production, producer Bill Oakley wrote on the online fan forum alt.tv.simpsons that David Bowie was being considered for the guest role in this episode.[5] Woods was one of animation director David Silverman\\'s favorite guest stars.[6] Mirkin said he provided one of the \"most fantastic\" performances ever on the show, and commented that he \"nailed\" all of his lines and was \"so funny, right at the top of his head\".[2] Mirkin said that when most guest stars come in to record their lines for the show, they are a little nervous because they have never done voice-over before. Mirkin noted, however, that Woods was a \"fearless guy\" and he was \"so excited to do it because he was a huge fan of the show\".[2] Silverman noted that in addition to his humorous ad-libbing, Woods\\'s tendency to hesitate while speaking was \"great for animation\", explaining that it made the character feel more realistic.[7] \"Homer and Apu\" features the popular Simpsons song \"Who Needs the Kwik-E-Mart?\", sung by Apu and the Simpson family. The song was written by all of the show\\'s writers in the writer\\'s room, and it was composed by Alf Clausen.[1] The song later appeared on the soundtrack album Songs in the Key of Springfield, which was released on March 18, 1997, and compiled many musical numbers from the show.[8]\\n',\n",

Beard said, \"Here the show presents its own instance of the global culture of consumer capitalism, transplanted intact and indistinguishably unaltered from the suburbs of America to a mountain top in some indefinable region of the post-partitioned Commonwealth nation of India, purely for the purpose of parodically criticizing the banality of quick-stop stores.\"[21]\\n',\n",

The most important thing to Mirkin while making the episode was to make sure that the elephant would be a \"bastard\" and behave rudely, unlike other animals on the show. For example, instead of putting people on his back, Stampy would put them in his mouth. Mirkin said the elephant \"never quite bonds because it\\'s a very cantankerous animal, a concept that was very important to this episode\".[3] Stampy has since been used several times in jokes later on in the series.[4] For example, Stampy made an appearance in the season nine episode \"Miracle on Evergreen Terrace\" in one of Bart\\'s dreams,[5] and in the season fourteen episode \"Large Marge\", where he is used by Bart in a stunt to help Krusty the Clown win back his popularity.[6] Stampy appeared briefly in The Simpsons Movie, where he tries to break down the giant glass dome lowered over Springfield.[7] The episode also introduces the character Cletus Spuckler. He is shown as one of the \"slack-jawed yokels\" gawking at Stampy in the Simpson family\\'s backyard. Cletus is not named in the episode, so the staff simply referred to him as the Slack-Jawed Yokel.[1]\\n',\n",

When Stampy runs away, he passes the Republican National Convention, with people cheering, and then he passes the Democratic National Convention, with people booing. This is a reference to the fact that an elephant is the symbol of the Republican Party.[1] Homer uses Mr. Cleanser, a parody of the detergent brand Mr. Clean, to clean the basement.[8] As Bart cleans, he accidentally scrubs the paint off an American Gothic painting hanging on the wall. Under the paint is a message signed by the painter, Grant Wood, reading: \"If you can read this, you scrubbed too hard.\"[3]\\n',\n",

Carter\", a possible synopsis for every episode of that series. He also imagines the episode with a thought of both Carter and Pyle standing next to each other. Carter yells, \"Pyle!\" and Pyle responds, \"Shazam!\".[3] As Stampy wreaks havoc throughout Springfield, Patty and Selma are sucked up by a tornado and fly through the air in rocking chairs, similar to a scene in the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz.[3]\\n',\n",

Oakley considered the episode to lack many \"zany\" jokes common for the show at that time, and described the episode as a companion piece to the season eight episode \"Homer\\'s Enemy\", in that a realistic character (Frank Grimes in that case) is placed in the unrealistic Simpsons universe and juxtaposed alongside Homer, creating conflict.[9]\\n',\n",

       "  '\"Homer Loves Flanders\" was the last episode to be pitched by Conan O\\'Brien before he left The Simpsons. David Richardson was assigned to write it, and Wes Archer to direct it.[1] Richardson wrote the episode at a Motel 6 in Hemet, California while he was dating an actress who was shooting a film there.[3] In this season, the staff wanted to take a deeper look at the relationships of the characters. One of the things they wanted to explore in particular was what Homer and Flanders have in common and how they could turn into friends.[4] Former show runner David Mirkin enjoyed making Homer and Flanders get along because they do not normally act that way.[4]\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n',\n",
       "  'The episode begins with the Simpson family watching a news broadcast in which the news anchor Kent Brockman calls the United States Army a \"kill-bot factory\". Mirkin said this was a joke the staff \"particularly loved to do\" because it pointed out how negative and mean-spirited news broadcasts can be, and how they are seemingly \"always trying to scare everybody\" by creating panic and depression.[4] In one scene in the episode, Marge begins hallucinating after drinking from Springfield\\'s water supply, which has been spiked with LSD by Springfield\\'s rival town, Shelbyville. The Fox network\\'s censors wanted the scene to be cut from the episode because they did not like the idea of Marge \"getting high\" on LSD. Mirkin defended the scene, and argued Marge was not \"doing it on purpose\", so the censors ultimately allowed the scene to remain in the episode.[4] The censors also hated Ned\\'s response to his wife telling him to drive his car faster (\"I can\\'t! It\\'s a Geo!\") fearing they could lose the car company\\'s sponsorship, but Mirkin kept the line in.[5] In another scene, Homer becomes frustrated at God for not getting the tickets to the game, so yells at a waffle stuck to the ceiling that he believes is God. Marge points out that it is just a waffle that Bart threw up there. This scene, inspired by some melted caramel stuck to the ceiling of the Simpsons writers\\' room, is one of Mirkin\\'s and Richardson\\'s \"all time favorite\" jokes.[4]\\n',\n",

As Homer is eating nachos at the football game, he makes up a song called \"Nacho Man\", a reference to Village People\\'s 1978 song \"Macho Man\".[2] Homer\\'s \"Rappin\\' Ronnie Reagan\" cassette is a reference to the 1984 Broadway show and novelty music video Rap Master Ronnie and Ronald Reagan. When Flanders is mistakenly arrested for taking drugs, Chief Wiggum asks him \"Where\\'s your Messiah now?\", a line commonly mistakenly believed to be spoken by Edward G. Robinson\\'s character Dathan in the 1956 film The Ten Commandments but in fact originates from Billy Crystal\\'s stand-up impersonation of Robinson. Ned\\'s dream involves him shooting at people inside the university clock tower based on the 1975 film The Deadly Tower, itself based on Charles Whitman\\'s 1966 killing spree. The scene where Homer chases Flanders\\'s car is a parallel of the sequence in Terminator 2: Judgment Day, in which Robert Patrick\\'s character T-1000 chases the heroes in the police car after escaping from the hospital. Homer morphing through the Flanders hedge also parodies how the T-1000\\'s shape shifting abilities were shown in the film. It has since become a popular internet meme. When Rod and Todd are watching television in the Flanders\\'s living room, a picture of Leonardo da Vinci\\'s painting The Last Supper can be seen behind them. The homeless shelter that Homer and Flanders visit is called Helter Shelter, a reference to the 1968 song \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles.[1] Helter Shelter would later go on to be used as title of an episode in the shows fourteenth season.\\n',\n",

Lisa and Lovell decide to create a new talking doll, Lisa Lionheart, voiced by Lisa herself. The doll, designed to look more realistic than Malibu Stacy and costing $46,000 to mass-produce and market, says inspirational and encouraging phrases for girls.

       "  'The episode was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and directed by Jeffrey Lynch. Before the episode aired, Malibu Stacy had already appeared many times on the show as one of Lisa\\'s dolls. The staff were trying to come up with an idea for an episode by going through the companies in the Simpsons universe, and Oakley suggested an episode involving the Malibu Stacy company. The plot of the episode was inspired by the Teen Talk Barbie talking doll that caused controversy in the United States in the early 1990s.[1] In July 1992, Mattel released Teen Talk Barbie, which spoke a number of phrases including \"Will we ever have enough clothes?\", \"I love shopping!\", and \"Wanna have a pizza party?\" Each doll was programmed to say four out of 270 possible phrases, so that there were over 200 million combinations. One of these 270 phrases was \"Math class is tough!\". Although only about 1.5% of all the dolls sold said the phrase, it led to criticism from the American Association of University Women because they regarded it as demeaning to women. In October 1992, Mattel announced that Teen Talk Barbie would no longer say the phrase, and offered a swap to anyone who owned a doll that did.[2]\\n',\n",

       "  'Oakley and Weinstein decided to include Abe in the episode because they had an \"obsession\" with old people. Weinstein said they both \"love them and seem to really hate them\" at the same time. He also said that they enjoy writing for characters such as Abe and Mr. Burns because of their \"out-datedness\", and because he and Oakley get to use dictionaries for looking up \"old time slang\".[3] Executive producer David Mirkin thought it was difficult to make Abe funny because he is a \"boring and tedious\" character. He thinks that even though \"Abe\\'s doing all these complaints, what makes him funny is that the things he says are actually funny in the context of the boring and tedium.\" Mirkin thought this was a \"big challenge, and Bill and Josh pulled it off very well.\"[4]\\n',\n",

       "  'When the episode was in production, Oakley\\'s wife Rachel Pulido was an enthusiastic Barbie collector. Oakley therefore spent a lot of time going to Barbie conventions across the United States and met many different collectors. At one convention, Oakley met the man who owned the world\\'s largest Barbie collection. The meeting between the two inspired the part of the episode where Lisa visits Smithers and it is revealed that Smithers is the owner of the world\\'s largest Malibu Stacy collection.[1] Kathleen Turner guest starred in the episode as Stacy Lovell. Mirkin thought Turner was \"completely game\" when she showed up at the recording studio to record her lines as she \"nailed\" her lines really fast. He added that he enjoyed directing her and he thought she had one of the best performances ever on The Simpsons.[4]\\n',\n",

Ben Matlock is a character from the NBC/ABC television series Matlock, portrayed by Andy Griffith and created by Dean Hargrove.[4] The crowd cheer for Matlock by singing a slightly changed version of the \"We Love You, Conrad\" song from stage musical Bye Bye Birdie.[5] Homer dances on giant piano keys recessed in the floor of the toy store, spoofing a scene from the 1988 film Big.[6] Lisa wants Lisa Lionheart to have \"the wisdom of Gertrude Stein, the wit of Cathy Guisewite, the tenacity of Nina Totenberg, the common sense of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and the down-to-earth good looks of Eleanor Roosevelt.\"[7]\\n',\n",

Joe, Doctor Colossus, and Steve Austin.[8] Lisa\\'s story about the Malibu Stacy doll saying phrases that are considered demeaning to women is based on the Teen Talk Barbie line of dolls and how they caused controversy.[9] During one scene in the episode, one girl\\'s Malibu Stacy doll says \"My Spidey Sense is tingling! Anyone call for a web-slinger?\", a reference to a practical joke by the Barbie Liberation Organization in the early 1990s in which the voiceboxes of talking Barbie and G.I.

He wrote: \"The fact that the less intellectual doll is vastly preferred over Lisa\\'s doll, even though Lisa\\'s objections are reasonable, demonstrates the ways in which reasonable ideas can be made to take a back seat to having fun and going with the flow. This debate is often played out in the real world, of course: Barbie is the subject of perennial criticism along the lines of Lisa\\'s critique of Malibu Stacy, yet remains immensely popular, and in general, we often see intellectual critiques of toys dismissed as \\'out of touch\\' or elitist.\"[15]\\n',\n",

       "  '\"The Springfield Connection\" was written by Jonathan Collier and directed by Mark Kirkland.[3] According to Collier, the inspiration for the episode was former The Simpsons executive producer Mike Reiss\\' wife. At one point, she had seriously decided that she wanted to become a police officer but it did not happen.[4] The joke where the police officers laugh at Marge for a long time was pitched by David Mirkin and features a \"crazy twist\" at the end where Wiggum says \"welcome aboard\". Mirkin liked the joke so much that he repeated it again at the end of the episode.[3] Marge uses a \"McGriff the crime dog\" hand puppet who says \"Help me bite crime\".[5] The hand puppet is a homage to McGruff the Crime Dog – the producers had wanted to use the real McGruff, but could not get permission to use the character.[3] The idea to have a counterfeit jeans ring was pitched because at the time there had been an explosion in the jeans market, and David Mirkin thought it was right to satirize it.[3]\\n',\n",

They had to consult with the American animators, who advised them to watch movies so they could properly animate the guns.[6] The original design for Marge\\'s police uniform had Marge\\'s hair standing up (as it normally is) with the hat on top. Director Mark Kirkland found that it made it awkward for staging in scenes, so they altered the design to have her hair pulled down.[6] David Mirkin later stated that if the design had been used, he would have asked for it to be changed because they were trying to depict Marge as a serious cop.[3]\\n',\n",

The couch gag, a parody of the gun barrel sequence[2] in the James Bond films, shows some similarities to that of Sean Connery\\'s own gun barrel sequences. Several references are made to the 1980s police drama Hill Street Blues: the briefing scene at the police station is similar and the background and end credits music, are parodies of the show\\'s theme.[2][7] Marge appears on an episode of COPS, and McGriff the dog is a reference to McGruff the Crime Dog, a US police public relations figure.[2] Additionally, Marge\\'s training sequences features homages to Police Academy (1984), Bullitt (1968), and Speed (1994).[2] Marge\\'s difficulties in scaling the wall in the police academy\\'s obstacle course references An Officer and a Gentleman, where the lone female cadet had similar issues. The Springfield Pops play the theme to the Star Wars films at an outdoor venue attended by Homer and Marge, and Homer mistakenly believes that the theme\\'s composer John Williams is dead, complaining: \"Laser effects, mirrored balls—John Williams must be rolling around in his grave!\".[8] Annoyed at Marge for becoming a police officer, Homer draws a line across the floor and says he is acting \"a la I Love Lucy.\" referenced to the television sitcom I Love Lucy from the 1950s.

Originally, there was a two-minute scene involving the two, but the writers cut it down considerably.[6] The producers also noted the constant flux of the Simpsons' economic state; one moment Homer appears to have his wallet full of cash, and the next, they do not even have a savings account. The animators also included a character other than Lenny or Homer with a beardline, something the producers did not like. Originally, when The Simpsons shorts aired on The Tracy Ullman Show, all the male characters had beardlines similar to Homer's; however, after the Simpsons became their own show, they decided to drop the beardline for the majority of the characters to make Homer unique.[7] After Homer gets fired, Bart feeds his cat a mixture of 88% ash and 12% carrots. The gag came from a real-life experience when Vitti tried to feed his cat a mixture of carrots and ash; however, the cat simply ate and regurgitated it.[5] The sequence with the Frosty Chocolate Milkshakes in which Bart dreams what he would do with the money from the stocks is a reference to The Tracey Ullman Show shorts.[8]\\n\",\n",

After all, we are from the land of chocolate!\") Executive producer Sam Simon was the one who suggested that they actually do a sequence in which Homer\\'s mind wanders off into an imaginary land made of chocolate.[3] The sequence was storyboarded by animator Kevin O\\'Brien, who designed it to be a parody of The Sound of Music, but supervising director David Silverman suggested it should be more original. Silverman storyboarded the revised sequence, and tried to make Homer \"deliriously happy\" as he skipped through the town.[2] He later recalled, \"I animated that scene frame by frame, I needed to draw the skip I wanted. Homer\\'s skipping sets the tone for that show.\"[9]\\n',\n",

Because censors objected to this joke, the writers replaced it with a sign reading \"Fudge Town\".[6] The \"Land of Chocolate\" sequence was set to a song based on music from the film Tucker: The Man and His Dream.[4] Composed by Alf Clausen, the song was later included in the 1999 compilation album Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons.[10] \"The Land of Chocolate\" was also featured as a level in The Simpsons Game, which was released in 2007.[11]\\n',\n",

Outraged by the students\\' attempt to \"learn for free\", the actors charge at the teachers and students, most of whom barely manage to escape in Otto\\'s dilapidated bus (although Üter is left behind and assaulted).

Bart revels in his newfound freedom to Marge's annoyance, and continues to manipulate the conflict between Skinner and the teachers' union. When the two sides reach an impasse, Marge demands that the PTA meet to devise a compromise. Skinner insists that even with his penny-pinching, government budget cuts have squeezed the school dry and the only way to increase spending on staff salaries and school supplies is to raise taxes.\\n\",\n",

Frustrated, Bart locks Krabappel and Skinner in the principal's office for several hours to negotiate. They devise a plan to use the school's cloakrooms to house convicts from the overcrowded Springfield Penitentiary.

The special also included oddsmaker Jimmy Vaccaro of The Mirage casino and hotel in Las Vegas, who had been taking bets on the shooter\\'s identity; a brief look at the casino\\'s tote board shows Homer as the favorite with 2:1 odds, while Maggie was a longshot at 70:1.

They succeeded, and the nine players who agreed to guest star were recorded over a period of six months,[7]\\xa0whenever they were playing the\\xa0Los Angeles Dodgers\\xa0or\\xa0California Angels.[5]\\xa0Each player recorded their part in roughly five minutes and spent the next hour writing autographs for the staff.[8]\\xa0In several cases, the writers were unable to get the player who was their first choice.[5]\\xa0Nolan Ryan,\\xa0Rickey Henderson,\\xa0Ryne Sandberg, and\\xa0Carlton Fisk\\xa0were among the players who turned down the chance to guest star.[9][8]\\n',\n",

       "  'Ken Griffey, Jr. became frustrated while recording his line \"there\\'s a party in my mouth and everyone\\'s invited\" because he had trouble understanding it.

The coaching staff forced him to cut his long hair, and was briefly dropped from the team line-up for not doing so. Many people believed the joke in the episode to be a reference to the incident, but \"Homer at the Bat\" was recorded a year before it happened.[11][13]\\xa0Many of the guest stars, including Terry Cashman, Wade Boggs and Darryl Strawberry all admit they are more well known because of their appearance in the episode, especially outside the United States, Cashman having \"Talkin\\' Softball\" requested more often than \"Talkin\\' Baseball\".[13]\\n',\n",
       "  'One of the hardest pieces of editing was the hypnotist segment, which featured several of the guest stars speaking in unison.

The scene featuring the explosion of stadium lights as Homer circles the basepaths is also taken directly from the film.[1][2]\\xa0The end song \"Talkin\\' Softball\" is a parody of \"Talkin\\' Baseball\" by Terry Cashman. Jeff Martin wrote the new version of the song, but Cashman was brought in to sing it.[6]\\xa0The scenes of the Power Plant team traveling from city to city by train, overlaid with the pennant of the city they are going to, is a reference to the 1942 film\\xa0The Pride of the Yankees.[16]\\xa0Carl\\xa0batting with a piano leg is a reference to\\xa0Norm Cash\\xa0of the\\xa0Detroit Tigers, who once tried to bat with a table leg in a game where Nolan Ryan was extremely overpowering and threw a\\xa0no-hitter.[5]\\xa0The team name on Mr. Burns\\' jersey, the Zephyrs, is a reference to the Twilight Zone episode \"The Mighty Casey\", which features a team called the Hoboken Zephyrs. When\\xa0Don Mattingly\\xa0is forced off the team for \"neglecting\" to shave off his \"sideburns\" by Mr. Burns, Mattingly privately states that he still preferred Burns to\\xa0George Steinbrenner, the owner of the\\xa0New York Yankees\\xa0at the time.
